Never Came Down

there you were, staring at the ground,  
waiting for me to come around.  
But I never came down from that cloud  
wasted the time we were allowed.

Streetlights bleed orange, you're crying
yeah, I see you.Â   
your lips are moving but i'm too high
i can't hear you

Said this time was the last one, 
yeah, I promised
Just one more night, i said, 
i got this 

And I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna stay gone,
And I guess I'm lying 'cause its where i belong.
i want to say i'm sorry but i won't though
i'll just let you leave and deal with vertigo

there you were, staring at the ground,  
waiting for me to come around.  
But I never came down from that cloud  
wasted the time we were allowed.

See your face sometimes, distorted through the haze.
Like a bad photograph, a ghost of better days. 
Did you call my name?  used to love the way you said it
then it changed slowly , turning to disappointment

And I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna break free, 
And I guess I'm lying 'cause maybe this is me.
you gave me too many chances, i know
i just can't be saved, just let it go

there you were, staring at the ground,  
waiting for me to come around.  
But I never came down from that cloud  
wasted the time we were allowed.
