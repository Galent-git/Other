Haunting Visions 

Etch the lyrics in my brain
If they hold, then I remain
If they fade, then I'm erased
If they break, just write my name

You can hear the screams down the hall, don't listen
You can see the holes in the walls, can't fix them
You can hear her call in the distance, don't beckon
You can see the world through my haunting vision

See the mark on my neck, something bit it
Can't feel much now, becoming static
Everywhere I look, I see their shadows
Everywhere I walk, they won't let me go

Etch the lyrics in my brain
If they hold, then I remain
If they fade, then I'm erased
If they break, just write my name

I made my own story a tragedy
Convinced myself I'm not enough for me
Said my voice was noise I had to drown
Built my walls, then burned them down

I've been trying to patch these holes
Still paying what I owe
Working quiet, stay in zone
Grinding steel against the bone
Yeah, I'm paranoid, I know
Always checking every rope
Getting ready for the show
Clock strikes, it's time to go

Etch the lyrics in my brain
If they hold, then I remain
If they fade, then I'm erased
If they break, just write my name
