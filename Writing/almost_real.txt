half formed thoughts on pixels and paper
barely enough to disappoint a dreamer  
see me standing out on both sides of the river  
don't know where i'm going ,  i'll figure that out later

Find me where worlds collide for a reason  
Hoping that the words don't change with the seasons  
over by the mountain top learning how to fly  
Laying down in bed , one hand to the sky

See me chasing any doubt that we were gonna make it  
Drinking all I can till I'm all out of thinking  
roaming every world where I didn't have to let go  
Staying up till dawn, head pressed against the window

Find me where it's almost real

i hate the man that you saw in me then
the one i can't become, not for lack of trying 
months of faith, writing and building
with hands of glass and bricks made of wishing

singing to the verses where i learned your name
this constant dreaming is getting out of hand
sky and back , don't let me think about it  
Your hand on my neck, yeah, i can almost feel it  

Find me where worlds collide for a reason  
Hoping that the words don't change with the seasons  
over by the mountain top learning how to fly  
Laying down in bed , one hand to the sky

See me chasing any doubt that we were gonna make it  
Drinking all I can till I'm all out of thinking  
roaming every world where I didn't have to let go  
Staying up till dawn, head pressed against the window

Find me where it's almost real

asked the sky for meaning, almost heard your name  
A dream within a dream, it's such a shame  
one day collapses, can't see the horizon  
Holding my breath , stuck in place, frozen 

If I find a way, you'll be the first to know  
But maybe this dream was never ours to own  
let's sit a while a let it dissipate
leave these familiar strangers to their fate

you can still..

Find me where worlds collide for a reason  
Hoping that the words won't change with the seasons  
over by the mountain top learning how to fly  
Laying down in bed , one hand to the sky

See me chasing any doubt that we were gonna make it  
Drinking all I can till I'm all out of thinking  
roaming every world cuz i don't know how to let go
Staying up till dawn, maybe today i'll see you out the window

Find me where it's almost real

yeah , it was almost real
