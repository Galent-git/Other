Grisaille


it's one of those days where I'm locked out my brain,  
Spirit is fractured, exhausted and drained.  
Fingers are slow, needin' the fire,  
Reach for the flame, get burned on the lighter.  

Why can't I think of the words that I need?  
This iron fatigue… a slow, silent bleed.  
dragged under water, it's harder to breathe,  
These shadows, they circle, when will they leave?  

Grisaille veil, the world bleeds to grey,
Every sharp edge softened away.
Lost in the art , thoughts are slow.
quiet in this a-chromatic glow.

It's in my mind and it came for my body,  
moving is harder than it's ever been.  
This ain't a life, man, this feel like a prison,  
a slow erosion, till nothing will remain.

Can't find the words, just the weight and the hum,  
This iron fatigue… has my own voice become  
void of all hope? Hard to believe
These shadows, they stifle,  they might never leave.  

Grisaille veil, the world bleeds to grey,
Every sharp edge softened away.
Lost in the art , thoughts are slow.
quiet in this a-chromatic glow.

Falling in and out of consciousness, the edges start to fray,
Each time I lose a little more, with every slip away.
Am I wakin' up or driftin' down? Head's gettin' cold,
A shadow-self on puppet strings, as the grey takes hold. 
Falling in and out of consciousness, nowhere to land,
Just this endless, gentle sinking, with no guiding hand. 
No reason, no meaning, just the ache, the need for cure,
Paralyzed and fading. How much more can I endure? 

No words left to find now, just the fog and the chill,  
This iron fatigue… makes my own pulse stand still.  
This strange, soft comfort as their darkness seeps,  
These shadows, they cradle, I will never leave.
