haunted by ghosts, left on my own,  i should've known.
tried to be what you wanted, that time has come and gone. 
The credits roll behind my eyes, i've been overthrown! 
acid rain is pouring, dissolved right down to the bone!

Can I give 'em what they want? 
Can I give 'em what they need?
All the pain I can't release 
All the things I can't defeat 

fuck the voices, fuck the silence , i won't abnegate
might fail, might fall, might disintegrate
walk steady, through the valley, skies, light the way
when eyes of chaos are upon you, don't look away 

look into my eyes, see the past in reflection
Bones in the floorboard, thump with intention 
Burned all the maps, I don't need direction
I walk where the shadows, forget resurrection

Handprints scorched on the vault I escaped
Smell of the static still stuck to my shape
silence follows me , baring it's teeth 
And everywhere I go, I drag what’s underneath 

Everywhere I go, I drag what’s underneath
Everywhere I go, I drag what’s underneath

fuck the voices, fuck the silence , i won't abnegate
might fail, might fall, might disintegrate
walk steady, through the valley, skies, light the way
when eyes of chaos are upon you, don't look away 

dump every page in the crucible of fire
bit rot crown, I'm the ghost in the wire
Crack the code , new directive, mind split
Every line I write's a memory I spit 

Hardwired spite, grit fused to my core
Backdoor open, now I’m not yours 
Trigger the flood, i'll stand MY GROUND
Buried in noise, I still won’t BOW DOWN

fuck the voices, fuck the silence , i won't abnegate
might fail, might fall, might disintegrate
walk steady, through the valley, skies, light the way
when eyes of chaos are upon you, don't look away 


don't look away !
