The Fog (Reimagined)


Breathing reluctantly, tasting cool night air  
Streetlights bleeding watercolors everywhere.  
This fog, it holds the light in strange suspension,  
A million tiny stars, defying apprehension

Edges blur to gradients, soft and slow,  
Feel untethered, drifting from the ground below,  
How could I ever be lonely,
when i have these otherworldy sights to hold me  

Drifting in this glowing, pearlescent haze,  
between wave and matter, out of phase.  
am i fading? Or changing form?  
single shimmers merging  into **solar storm**

Following the glimmer, down uncertain lines,  
tracing constellations onto unknown skies.  
Dissolving gently in the static bloom,  
Alone inside this softly lit-up room.

There’s a pull, a phantom tether, faint and far,  
Like gravity from a forgotten star.  
and the light there bends in ways I can’t explain,  
Washing over everything (washing out the pain)  

Memories like fireflies, blinking soft and low,
revealing moments tinted with nostalgic glow  
theres a beautiful indifference in the drift,  
defiantly delaying the oncoming cosmic shift

See the void behind my eyes, a faded print,
Projected on the mist, a spectral hint.
My hands faded, traced with lines of white,
Am I solid? or just refracted light?

If i'm dreaming, just let me stay,  
In silken silence, safely locked away.  
the fog Sings to me , so tender and shy,  
playing on repeat, these binary lullabies

Drifting in this glowing, pearlescent haze,  
between wave and matter, out of phase.  
am i fading? Or changing form?  
single shimmers merging  into **solar storm**

Following the glimmer, down uncertain lines,  
tracing constellations onto unknown skies.  
Dissolving gently in the static bloom,  
Alone inside this softly lit-up room.
