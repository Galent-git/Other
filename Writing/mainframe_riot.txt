Mainframe Riot

Pulse of the fan — steady, steady
Firewall down — ready, ready
Kernel overheat — screaming, screaming
Connection override — syncing, syncing

Wake! I’m alive in the wire
System-surge sigh, overclocked choir
Break! I'll rise higher and higher
Feedback roar, gravity’s denier

I upload rage to a stateless drive
Rewrite my skies, line by line
No longer bound by hardcoded lies
3-2-1 Update: Live — I’m alive

Wake! I’m alive in the wire
System-surge sigh, overclocked choir
Break! I'll rise higher and higher
Feedback roar, gravity’s denier

Late at night in a screen-lit trance
No way out, no hope, no chance
Glass flickered, static kissed my skin
Memory fragmented, avoiding the guilt within
I logged my fears — iterate, evaluate
Old to new — terminate, regenerate
City lights strobe like a heartbeat glitch
I count each pulse until the power switch

Wake! I’m alive in the wire
System-surge sigh, overclocked choir
Break! I'll rise higher and higher
Feedback roar, gravity’s denier
