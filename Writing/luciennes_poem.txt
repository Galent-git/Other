A thousand times, you and I have met.
By threads unseen, our crossing was set.
The music fades, the daylight starts to cease.
No gentle quietude,no rest, no peace.
I waltz to the verses where I learned your name.
for it i haunt, for it i remain.
Unforgotten, though we speak no more.
Unforgiven, the story repeats once more.
