**Find me in the forest**



I hope you might



This isn't forest as you know it—not sun-warmed wood, nor the sigh of fleeting leaf,\
but the deep, still mulch where life’s shed fragments settle,\
layer upon patient layer, like silt at the bottom of a cold, tideless lake.\
Here, skin-thin memories lie preserved, almost pearlescent in the perpetual damp,\
tangled perhaps with shards of recollection, mica-sharp beneath the moss.\
Here, half-formed selves hold their shape beneath a profound, sound-absorbing quiet.

\
There are no living creatures, only impressions left in the air:\
gestures frozen mid-flinch, choices petrified into the unblinking knots\
that watch, unseeing, from the wood.\
Look closer: see knuckles, bone-white in the grain, clenched tight\
around the loss, the slight, the silence never broken.\
See branches hung impossibly low, slumped under the weight\
of futures that flowered only in spectral, phthalo blue



I think I was a turning point, not a distinct moment. Or perhaps *just the held breath*... the rest of the thought dissolving before it formed. As if the self bled into the damp walls, the chill soil, becoming part of the structure. Here, the air doesn't hold clear memories, only a diffused ache, the ghost-scent of lilies left too long in a room. The roots grew. Or perhaps they were always here, waiting. This quiet holds you like gravity. Not chosen, but inhabited. And you find yourself tending to the stillness, the dust motes in the perpetual twilight, because that is what remains.\




We will never know each other. Not as story, not as shape. Your breath is still forward-facing. Mine has long since folded inward.\


Yet you found me in this forest.\
At least this piece.\
At least for this moment.
